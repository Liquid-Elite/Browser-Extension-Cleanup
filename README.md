# 🔍 Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## 🛡️ Objective
To learn how to inspect installed browser extensions for potential security risks, identify unnecessary or suspicious ones, and safely remove them to enhance browser performance and privacy.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Any modern **web browser** (Google Chrome was used in this task)
- **Chrome Web Store** for extension review
- Online resources and forums for security research
- GitHub for documentation

---

## 📋 Task Instructions (Mini Guide)
1. **Open your browser's extension manager**  
   - For Chrome: `chrome://extensions`

2. **Review all installed extensions carefully**
   - Look for extensions you don’t remember installing or no longer use.

3. **Check each extension’s permissions**
   - Review what access each extension has (e.g., browsing data, clipboard, etc.)

4. **Read reviews and check developer reputation**
   - Visit the Chrome Web Store and analyze user ratings and complaints.

5. **Identify and remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions**
   - Prioritize removing ones with excessive permissions or poor reviews.

6. **Restart the browser**  
   - Ensures that all background scripts are terminated and changes are applied.

7. **Observe performance or security improvement**

8. **Research how malicious extensions can cause harm**
   - Learn how they can hijack traffic, log keystrokes, or act as spyware.

9. **Document everything**  
   - Note removed extensions, reasons, and key learning.
